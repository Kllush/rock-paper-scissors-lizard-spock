### Continued development

This project started as a quick challenge to keep my mind busy and suddenly it became more than that. I need to get used to the block and grid layout, and stop using flex as a crutch.

I like the JS part of building a website and will keep studying that, also I m still struggling with media queries and animations, I understand what they do but they dont end up as expected, I need to take more time sketching the layout before I commit to something.

Last thing would be to clean up my CSS more, im sure I have many classes that didnt needed to be there, and lastly, dip my feet in SCSS, at least for nesting (also the use of variables in CSS).


Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
